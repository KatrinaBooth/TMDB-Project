<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is the final assignment for the Programmatic Data Wrangling module at Digital Futures Academy. Over 1.5 days, I conducted exploratory data analysis on a small but comprehensive movie dataset, drawing insights to better understand key trends and patterns.

The deliverable is a single Jupyter notebook (ipynb file) containing the full exploration, thoroughly annotated and commented for ease of interpretation.

Key outcomes include:

* Three Python visualizations showcasing insights drawn from the data.
* Two key findings explicitly stated in Markdown format, with code explanations to detail what was most interesting or surprising.
* In-depth analysis of two selected movies, including their unique attributes and comparisons to similar films.

These are the core requirements, though further exploration was conducted when time permitted.
