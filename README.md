<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is the final assignment for the Programmatic Data Wrangling module at Digital Futures Academy. Over 1.5 days, I conducted exploratory data analysis on a small but comprehensive movie dataset, drawing insights to better understand key trends and patterns.

<!-- Deliverables -->
## Deliverables

* A single Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) containing the full exploration, thoroughly annotated and commented for ease of interpretation. This includes:
  * Three Python visualizations showcasing insights drawn from the data.
  * Two key findings explicitly stated in Markdown format, with code explanations to detail what was most interesting or surprising.
  * In-depth analysis of two selected movies, including their unique attributes and comparisons to similar films.

<!-- Outcomes -->
## Outcomes

* 'Adventure', 'Animation' and 'Science Fiction' are the most popular genres on average.
* These genres are also top scoring when looking at the average budget for each genre, suggesting a potential relationship between popularity and budget.
* The most popular film in the dataset is Minions.
* Minions has a substantially lower budget compared to the other films in the same genre but its popularity is 20 times larger.
* The average popularity of films shows a general upward trend over time.
