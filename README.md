**Project requirements and deliverables:**

This is the end of module assignment for Programmatic Data Wrangling, where you'll be perform Exploratory Data Analysis and draw insights from a small, but comprehensive movie data.
Your single deliverable to submit is 1 ipynb file containing all your exploration.
It is expected that your notebook is thoroughly annotated & code commented for it to be easily accessed & interpreted. 

Your task is to freely explore the data & draw insights from it. However, the following outcomes are expected:
3 Python visualisations showcasing insights drawn from the data
2 keypoints drawn from the data - explicitly stated in Markdown format and explained by your code & findings. What did you find most interesting? Or most surprising? Why is that?
Select 2 movies on which to provide a more in-depth single observation analysis. Why have you selected these two? What's interesting about them? How do they compare to similar movies?

These are minimal requirements for this project. Feel free to both expand on them, as well as set more targets for your own exploration!
